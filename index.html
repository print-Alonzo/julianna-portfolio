      <h2>Self-Introduction</h2>
      <p>I am Julianna Alexis E. Palileo, an ID 122 undergraduate student studying the Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. I am currently 20 years old and I was born on November 18, 2004. I am studying accountancy in hopes of becoming a certified public accountant and lawyer in the future. I live in Las Pinas City and have only one sibling. I also love joining organizations and doing performing arts specifically, dancing and singing.</p>

      <h2>Reflection on PCK Results</h2>
      <p>According to my PCK results I am particularly suited for enterprising and artistic jobs. This comes as no surprise to me as I love taking on the role of a leader and project manager— additionally my experience in performing arts and the industry in general would come in handy for any artistically heavy jobs. Furthermore in a work environment I typically look for recognition, achievement, and working conditions. This aligns with my passion for succeeding and generating positive or successful results. Furthermore I am particularly proficient in numerical or mathematical problems and interpreting and analyzing written information which is very fitting for the course I am currently pursuing. My main jobs were aligned with program directors, producers, financial managers, and lawyers.</p>

          <span class="position">NTH Entertainment – Artist</span>
          <span>Taguig, Manila | May to October 2022</span>

        <div class="description">
          <ul>
            <li>At the time NTH Entertainment was a start-up entertainment company with both trainees and artists. My group was the first marketable artist under the company. Despite being employees we were in charge of brainstorming and creating our own content.</li>
            <li>Aside from being an active artist I was also a social media manager and an active project planner.
              <ul>
                <li>Under my supervision our Tiktok account was able to reach 5,000 followers and 400,000 likes within a year. I was able to do this by crafting a social media calendar for each month that had assigned content per day or week. The content was specific to our branding as a group and what was currently famous in the market.</li>
                <li>With the help of my fellow members we were able to produce several dance covers, vlogs, and even perform in schools such as De La Salle University and San Beda University. Each of these events were treated as projects. I contributed by being the assigned secretary in our meetings and scheduling practices, posting dates, captions, and more.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>My experience with NTH Entertainment taught me a lot about the entertainment industry and what goes into making content. Fortunately, this company allowed me to experience content creation both as an artist and as a behind-the-scenes staff.</li>
